# Project Overview
---
In this project I trained a model which classifies news article titles in 4 categories namely : Business, Entertainment, Health, Science and Technology. I used dataset given by UCI Machine Learning Repository, it can be found [here.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Aggregator) 
I used Pandas for data loading and intial data cleaning then tokenized the data. Further cleaned the tokenized data using StopWords. I used Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify the titles. Then I checked the accuracy and stored the trained model using pickle.
